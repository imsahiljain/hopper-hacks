## üí° Inspiration
<b>What is an NFT?</b> <br>
An NFT stands for non-fungible token. You might be thinking, I heard people buying NFTs, so are they just buying tokens? Yes, and no. They are buying ownership of a digital item, so in a way they are buying the item, but just a tokenized form of it. Then, they own the NFT completely, and can freely use it anywhere.

<b>Why is an NFT so good?</b> <br>
Even if someone copy and pasted the NFT into their website, blockchain technology would verify who the owner is. The need for citations would be gone, and plagiarism would be put to a big stop. This impact is HUGE, as designers who spend their time designing things online could actually make what their work is worth. Once something is published online, anyone can copy it with a simple copy and paste. With NFTs, this still happens, but the owner can be verified with no doubt, as the owner is the token holder.

<b>Why should the future generation (children) know what an NFT is?</b> <br>
NFTs will definitely take over everything digital. They are a fast and secure way to distribute virtual resources, and that‚Äôs why the future generation should learn about it. Children will grow up with NFTs being a daily part of their life, and should understand them so they can excel in today‚Äôs world.
